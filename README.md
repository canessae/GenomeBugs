GenomeBugs: Insect Biodiversity Dynamics  from their Genome Sequences

The GenomeBugs project to study the dynamics of insects biodiversity can be a solution to uncover and visualize distinctive patterns embedded in the intrinsic data organization of their whole genome sequencing. The goal is to detect, track and  predict changes over time along the history of insects life using, e.g., available resources from NCBI Genome Datasets. GenomeBugs is based on our recent Genomebits open source program to study characteristics of signals from genome sequences of viruses according to their progression along the nucleotide bases position. We aim to determine today's genetic information of insects at a single nucleotide level to pass it to future generations of humans. 

Our planet Earth so far as we know is unique and it contains life depicted in millions of creatures of different species. Most classified species on Earth are insects, and our human life depends on their biodiversity, behavior and transformations. A small change in these variables, some species may face extinction and in turn it may affect our natural living environment. Therefore it becomes extremely urgent to combat  any loss of life biodiversity for the well-being of all species. 

To achieve this goal, we propose to consider quantifying and characterizing the dynamics of insects biodiversity in order to preserve and understand better their Nature.

We aim to "solve" this challenge by implementing GenomeBugs, a tool to study the dynamics of biodiversity by uncovering distinctive patterns embedded in the intrinsic data organization of the genome sequences of insects. 

We have developed a open source Graphics User Interface (GUI) to the intrinsic data organization of any genome sequences

according to its progression along the nucleotide bases position. This method is based on a finite alternating sum series

having independently distributed terms associated with binary (0,1) indicators for the nucleotide bases A,C,T,G. From the view

of statistics, such a sequence is equivalent to a discrete-valued time series for statistical identification and characterization of data sets as studied in financial series.

The GUI runs under Linux Ubuntu O.S., and it can be useful to study the dynamics of insects genome variants using available  available resources, e.g., those from NCBI Genome Datasets. 

This goal is important since allows to detect, track and predict changes over time along the history of insects life. If we determine historical genetic information at a single nucleotide level we can preserve it for the benefit of future generations.
