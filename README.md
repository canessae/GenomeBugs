GenomeBugs: Insect Biodiversity Dynamics  from their Genome Sequences

The GenomeBugs project to study the dynamics of insects biodiversity can be a solution to uncover and visualize distinctive patterns embedded in the intrinsic data organization of their whole genome sequencing. The goal is to detect, track and  predict changes over time along the history of insects life using, e.g., available resources from NCBI Genome Datasets. GenomeBugs is based on our recent Genomebits open source program to study characteristics of signals from genome sequences of viruses according to their progression along the nucleotide bases position. We aim to determine today's genetic information of insects at a single nucleotide level to pass it to future generations of humans.
